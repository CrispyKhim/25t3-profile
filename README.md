# DevSoc 25T3 Trainee Application

- Progress: Ongoing
- Deadline: 12th September Friday

# Editor's Note
- I hadn't done HTML / CSS / JS for such a long time (since high school)... So expect the worst when looking at this üòÅ
- In a past HTML/CSS project I did, I used "main" and "aside" and "section" HTML tags. I had no idea where I learnt to use them but I decided to use them here. Though it properly doesn't do much, it apparently is good for developers to read the code...

# My Idea
- I took the theme as having dreams... quite literally... 
- The gradient background represents the time of day. 
- The sidebar navigation is representative of "dreams", as emphasised with gifs and images. 
- Though the animation was mainly for show, I chose smooth and flowy animations to create a more relaxed setting.
