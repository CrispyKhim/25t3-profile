            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>About the Website</b></p>
            <p>This website is my entry to DevSoc's Trainee Application for 25T3!</p>
            <p>The theme, "Dreams", was to be incorporated in the website. I took the artistic liberty to use dream motifs and visual elements to design the website.</p>
            <p>I will create an actual personal website sometime...</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Making of the Website</b></p>
            <p>This website was built in HTML, CSS & JS. It has been about one year since I last made a website so the quality of the website may not be great... 🥲</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, I took this opportunity to touch up on my web development skills starting with the basics! This website utilises the CSS flexbox layout.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Use the navigation on the sidebar to learn more about me! 😁</p>
            <p>Toggle the switch to change the layout for a more "dreamy" feel of the website!</p>

            <h1>🚀 Projects</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Back in high school, I created a few projects (some as assignments and some personal projects) which were incomplete and unpublished.</p>
            <p>I plan to polish, refurbish, and publish said projects once I find the time to do so and when I am more skilled.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I suppose you could help me out by letting me join this program 😉🙏</p>

            <h2>🙋 I volunteer!</h2>
            <p>As introverted as I may be, I enjoy going out and helping people. Back in high school, I used to volunteer and help out many clubs which included a coffee club, a breakfast club, an environment club, etc.</p>
            <p>As of now, this passion has yet to be distinguished, leading me to sign up to some volunteering programs offered by Arc UNSW. As of 25T3, I've involved myself in eReuse and Food Hub!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>🎱 I sport?</h2>
            <p>Recently, I've been interested in playing pool / cue / snookers or however you call it! I can be bad at times, but watch me cook! 😎</p>
            <p>Other than that, I enjoy playing tennis and table tennis, though I have no-one to play with anymore... 🥲</p>
            <br>
            <h2>💤 I dream!?</h2>
            <p>Yes, I dream. I am hoping to become a software engineer or something else that involves coding! I also hoped to do a bit of streaming or video editing at the very least to build upon my technical skills.</p>
