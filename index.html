            <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
            <p>This website is my entry to DevSoc's Trainee Application for 25T3! The theme, "Dreams", was to be incorporated in the website.</p>
            <p>I took the artistic liberty to use dream motifs and visual elements to design the website.</p>
            <p>Use the navigation on the sidebar to learn more about me! 😁</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>My name is Christopher Khim. Online, I go by the alias <i>Crispy</i>.</p>
            <p>I am a first year Computer Science student studying at UNSW, though I may switch to Software Engineering at some point... 😁</p>
            <p>I can be quite introverted at times in person, but I am most active and social online!</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Going Out: </b>Despite my lack of social skills and introverted personality, I like to hangout and "socialise" with people!</li>

                <li><b>Gaming: </b>Often, I play mobile gacha games notably CookieRun: Kingdom, Arknights, Honkai: Star Rail. I do play PC games now and then. </li>
                <li><b>Vibing to pop music: </b>I've mainly been listening to j-pop and OSTs from games... Though I will, at some point, broaden my music album with a variety of songs. </li>

            <h1>🚀 Projects</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Back in high school, I created a few projects (some as assignments and some personal projects) which were incomplete and unpublished.</p>
            <p>I plan to polish, refurbish, and publish said projects once I find the time to do so and when I am more skilled.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I suppose you could help me out by letting me join this program 😉😉</p>

            <h2>I volunteer!</h2>
            <p>As introverted as I may be, I enjoy going out and helping people. Back in high school, I used to volunteer and help out many clubs which included a coffee club, a breakfast club, an environment club, etc.</p>
            <p>As of now, this passion has yet to be distinguished, leading me to sign up to some volunteering programs offered by Arc UNSW. As of 25T3, I've involved myself in eReuse and Food Hub!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>I sport?</h2>
            <p>Recently, I've been interested in playing pool / cue / snookers or however you call it! I can be bad at times, but watch me cook! 😎</p>
            <p>Other than that, I enjoy playing tennis and table tennis, though I have no-one to play with anymore... 🥲</p>
